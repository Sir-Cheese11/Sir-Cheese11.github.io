## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1:
In lab 1, we learned how to run Linux and access Ubuntu through Linux. In order to access the files for the lab, we also had to clone the Git Repository. We also created a GitHub Account and used it to edit and finish our code, then pushed it to GitHub so my professor could see our work. This is one of my favorites because it was an effortless and straightforward start to learning more about coding.

Lab 2:
In lab 2, we used everything we learned from lab 1 and added to our tools by using strings and inputs/outputs. These can help us represent a sequence of characters to show the reader's input and display the corresponding output. This lab helped us learn the basics of strings and inputs/outputs and how to use them correctly.

Lab 3:
In lab 3, we continued to add to the difficulty and we were introduced to doubles and learned to use doubles by calculating the BMR of a man and a woman. I liked this lab because it showed us the importance of the double and how it functions.
